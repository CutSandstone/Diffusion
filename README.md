## Slide 7:

Simple autoencoder model for mnist dataset

dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset

Played around with using the model for diffusion, worked as expected (not well)

## Slide 12:

Digit creation using variational autoencoders

Digit is created purely from standard distribution, not a specific digit
